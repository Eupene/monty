Stack: A stack is a linear data structure in which elements may only be added to or taken away from the list's top side. Stacks are governed by the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, which states that the element that was added last is also the first element deleted. Adding and deleting pieces from the stack are referred to as push and pop operations, respectively.

In a linear data structure called a queue, elements may only be added from one side of the list, known as the rear, and they can only be removed from the other side, known as the front. The FIFO (First In First Out) principle, which states that the element added to the list first is the element discarded, is followed by the queue data structure.

LIFO stands for "Last In, First Out," and it refers to the behavior of a stack data structure. In a LIFO stack, the last item added (pushed) to the stack is the first one to be removed (popped) from the stack. It follows a principle similar to a stack of books where the last book placed on top is the first one to be taken off when needed. 

FIFO stands for "First In, First Out," and it describes the behavior of a queue data structure. In a FIFO queue, the first item inserted is the first one to be removed. It follows a principle similar to people waiting in a line, where the person who arrived first is the first one to be served.
